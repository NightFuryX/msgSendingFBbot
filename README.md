# msgSendingFBbot
it's stupid python bot that sends a message to another user. That's it

this shit requires CHrome webdriver for it to function. you can donload it here : https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
and then copy and paste it in yout python path, it should look like this:
C:\Users\"your username here"\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32

Oh it also requires selenium to run so just type in your terminal : pip install selenium

and this shit should work, enjoy!
